    <div class="box" id=box1><h3 class="gerecht">Beef</h3>
        <p>Your favorite cow, sliced 'n' diced! It used to be a happy animal, full of life - now it's dead and roasted to the core. Enjoy and think of the cow's family, which is bitterly mourning her loss.</p>
        <div class="price"> E 23,99 </div></div>

    <div class="box" id=box1><h3 class="gerecht2">Sushi</h3>
        <p>Something that could be fish, served with something that may very well be rice. We call it sushi, though some snooty Japanese sushi chefs might disagree. Grand Restaurant "Chez Msr. Onderstal" can not be held responsible for possible food poisoning.</p>
        <div class="price"> E 19,99 </div></div>

    <div class="box"><h3 class="gerecht3">Chicken</h3>
        <p>What's to explain, people? Our high-quality chicken filet contains at least 10% chicken! That's right folks: about twice as much as McDonald's nuggets! We recommend our famous "Meatpulp sauce" as a topping.</p>
        <div class="price"> E 15,99 </div></div>
